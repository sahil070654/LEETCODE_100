DOUBTS
1. MERGE INTERVALS :
  Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
  Example 1:
  Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

2. SET MATRIX ZEROES :
  Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
  Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
  Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]


3. REVERSE NODES IN K-GROUP:
  Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
  k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
  You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

4. LARGEST RECTANGLE IN HISTOGRAM:
  Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram
  Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
  Output: 10
  Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
  The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
 
5. Robot Bounded In Circle:
  On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:
  The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
  The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
  The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
  The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
  The robot can receive one of three instructions:
  "G": go straight 1 unit.
  "L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
  "R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
  The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
  Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
  Output: true
  Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
  "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
  "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
  Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
  Based on that, we return true.


6. You are given:

An integer n representing the number of books.

An integer shelfWidth representing the maximum width of a single shelf.

An integer array height[] where height[i] is the height of the i-th book.

An integer array width[] where width[i] is the width of the i-th book.

You must place the books in order on shelves such that:

The sum of widths on a shelf does not exceed shelfWidth.

The height of a shelf is the maximum height of a book placed on it.

Return the minimum total height of the bookshelf when all books are placed.
