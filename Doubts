DOUBTS
1. MERGE INTERVALS :
  Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
  Example 1:
  Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

2. SET MATRIX ZEROES :
  Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
  Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
  Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]


3. REVERSE NODES IN K-GROUP:
  Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
  k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
  You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

4. LARGEST RECTANGLE IN HISTOGRAM:
  Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram
  Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
  Output: 10
  Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
  The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
 
5. Robot Bounded In Circle:
  On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:
  The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
  The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
  The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
  The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
  The robot can receive one of three instructions:
  "G": go straight 1 unit.
  "L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
  "R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
  The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
  Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
  Output: true
  Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
  "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
  "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
  "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
  Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
  Based on that, we return true.


6. You are given:

An integer n representing the number of books.

An integer shelfWidth representing the maximum width of a single shelf.

An integer array height[] where height[i] is the height of the i-th book.

An integer array width[] where width[i] is the width of the i-th book.

You must place the books in order on shelves such that:

The sum of widths on a shelf does not exceed shelfWidth.

The height of a shelf is the maximum height of a book placed on it.

Return the minimum total height of the bookshelf when all books are placed.


7. How to identify wethere the given question is better to be solved in greedy or dp .

8. How to identify when to apply DFS / BFS based on which scenario.

9. Christy is interning at HackerRank. One day she has to distribute some chocolates to her colleagues. She is biased towards her friends and plans to give them more than the others. One of the program managers hears of this and tells her to make sure everyone gets the same number.

  To make things difficult, she must equalize the number of chocolates in a series of operations. For each operation, she can give  pieces to all but one colleague. Everyone who gets a piece in a round receives the same number of pieces.

  Given a starting distribution, calculate the minimum number of operations needed so that every colleague has the same number of pieces.

  Sample Input

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
1           t = 1
4           arr[] size n = 4
2 2 3 7     arr =[2, 2, 3, 7]
Sample Output
2
Explanation
Start with [2,2,3,7]
Add 1 to all but the 3rd element [3,3,3,8]
Add 5 to all but the 4th element [8,8,8,8]

Two operations were required.
