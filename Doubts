DOUBTS
1. MERGE INTERVALS :
  Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
  Example 1:
  Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

2. SET MATRIX ZEROES :
  Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
  Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
  Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]


3. REVERSE NODES IN K-GROUP:
  Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
  k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
  You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

4. LARGEST RECTANGLE IN HISTOGRAM:
  Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram
  Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
  Output: 10
  Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
  The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
